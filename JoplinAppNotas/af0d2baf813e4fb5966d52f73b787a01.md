There are details on our Github website on how to do this.\\\n\\\n- Select your Arduino Board and Serial Port in the Tools drop-down menu.\\\n  NOTE: Grbl only officially supports 328p-based Arduinos, like the Uno.\\\n  Using other boards will likely not work!\\\n\\\n- Then just click 'Upload'. That's it!\\\n\\\nFor advanced users:\\\n  If you'd like to see what else Grbl can do, there are some additional\\\n  options for customization and features you can enable or disable. \\\n  Navigate your file system to where the Arduino IDE has stored the Grbl \\\n  source code files, open the 'config.h' file in your favorite text \\\n  editor. Inside are dozens of feature descriptions and #defines. Simply\\\n  comment or uncomment the #defines or alter their assigned values, save\\\n  your changes, and then click 'Upload' here. \\\n\\\nCopyright (c) 2015 Sungeun K.
