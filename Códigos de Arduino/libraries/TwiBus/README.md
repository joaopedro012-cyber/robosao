# TwiBus Arduino Library
This library allows scanning the TWI (I2C) bus in search of connected devices addresses and data.
If a device found is running the [Timonel bootloader](https://github.com/casanovg/timonel.git), it returns its version number. It uses the [TimonelTwiM](https://github.com/casanovg/Nb_TimonelTwiM.git) library object definition
